🚀 LangChain 25 Days Learning Series

This repository documents my 25-day structured learning journey into LangChain, focusing on mastering the core framework, integrating LLMs with external data sources, and building intelligent AI systems.

🧠 What I Learned

Throughout this series, I explored LangChain from foundational to advanced concepts:

🏗️ LangChain Fundamentals – Architecture, core components (LLMs, Prompts, Chains, Agents, Memory)

✍️ Prompt Engineering – Crafting reusable and structured prompts using PromptTemplate & ChatPromptTemplate

🔗 Chains & Workflows – Implementing LLMChain, SequentialChain, and custom pipelines

🧩 Memory Systems – Adding contextual awareness using Buffer, Window, and Knowledge Graph Memory

🤖 Agents & Tools – Building reasoning agents with ReAct, tool calling, and API integration

📄 Document Loading & Processing – Handling PDFs, CSVs, and web data sources

💠 Text Embeddings – Generating and comparing embeddings using OpenAI and HuggingFace models

🧭 Vector Databases – Leveraging FAISS, Pinecone, and Chroma for similarity search

🧩 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) – Combining retrievers and LLMs for context-aware Q&A

🛠️ Custom Tool Creation – Integrating custom Python tools into agent workflows

🧠 Advanced Agents – Multi-step reasoning, conversational agents, and multi-agent collaboration

🔍 LangSmith & LangServe – Tracing, monitoring, and deploying LangChain applications

🎯 Outcomes

By completing this 25-day learning challenge, I am now able to:

✅ Design and build LLM-powered applications using LangChain
✅ Connect external data sources (documents, APIs, databases) to LLMs
✅ Implement memory-aware chatbots and contextual assistants
✅ Build RAG systems for document-based question-answering
✅ Deploy LangChain workflows using FastAPI & LangServe
✅ Debug, trace, and monitor pipelines using LangSmith
