LangChain 25 Days Learning Series

This repository contains my 25-day structured learning journey into LangChain, focusing on mastering the core framework, integrating LLMs with external data sources, and building intelligent AI systems.

🧠 What I Learned

During this series, I explored LangChain from its foundations to advanced concepts, including:

LangChain Fundamentals – Architecture, core components (LLMs, Prompts, Chains, Agents, Memory)

Prompt Engineering – Creating reusable and structured prompts using PromptTemplate and ChatPromptTemplate

Chains and Workflows – Using LLMChain, SequentialChain, and custom pipelines

Memory Systems – Implementing conversation memory (Buffer, Window, and Knowledge Graph Memory)

Agents and Tools – Building reasoning agents with ReAct, tool calling, and API integration

Document Loading and Processing – Working with PDFs, CSVs, and web data

Text Embeddings – Generating and comparing embeddings using OpenAI and HuggingFace models

Vector Databases – Using FAISS, Pinecone, and Chroma for similarity search

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) – Combining retrievers and LLMs for context-aware responses

Custom Tool Creation – Integrating custom Python tools into agent workflows

Advanced Agents – Multi-step reasoning, conversational agents, and multi-agent collaboration

LangSmith and LangServe – Tracing, monitoring, and deploying LangChain applications

🎯 Outcomes

By completing this learning series, I am now able to:

Design and build LLM-powered applications using LangChain

Connect external data sources (documents, APIs, databases) to LLMs

Implement memory-aware chatbots and contextual assistants

Build Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for document-based Q&A

Deploy LangChain workflows using FastAPI and LangServe

Debug and trace pipelines using LangSmith
